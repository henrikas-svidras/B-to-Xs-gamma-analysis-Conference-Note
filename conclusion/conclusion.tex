\section{Conclusion}

We present a measurement of the photon-energy spectrum in the $B$ meson rest frame from \BtoXsgamma decays using hadronic-tagging of the partner $B$ meson. We also report the inclusive branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(\BtoXsgamma)$ for various thresholds, starting at $\EB>1.8~\gev$. The results are consistent with the Standard Model and world averages \cite{HFLAV:2019otj}.
